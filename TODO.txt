Lots of stuff left to do....

- Many methods are currently implemented awkwardly,
  some requiring more arguments than the C++ API even requires.
  XSUB arguments can have default values, but I had trouble getting
  some types of args to work (like strings weren't working,
  but maybe that's fixable -- the problem was that you only have
  assignment with an equals sign (=) available, while some data types
  might not be assignable like that).
  Another problem is polymorphic methods, where the same method
  can have different call signatures (e.g. pass in either a Vector3
  or three Reals). For now I've simply been chosing one,
  but it'd be better if all the different ways would work.
  I guess it could be done in Perl, just it would be annoying.
  (Say you have three different XSUBs, then in the Perl module
   a single method calls one of those depending on the arguments
   passed in. But having three different XSUBs, now you have to
   also implement the CODE and OUTPUT section for each one...
   Doing this hundreds of times gets tedious.)
- Constants are not implemented well at all. How to do them right?
- Tests....
- More examples (that's the fun part :)
- Zillions of classes and methods to wrap. For now, I've just been
  wrapping what's necessary to make the examples. According to
  the API docs, there are 541 classes; I'm not sure how many of
  those are useful to wrap, though. Things like Ogre::Singleton<T>
  or Ogre::SharedPtr<T> probably don't make sense to wrap.
  Right now, I'm wrapping classes necessary for OGRE's "Basic Tutorial 5",
  including ExampleApplication and ExampleFrameListener classes.
