0.29 2007-11-14 | cameratrack.pl, particleFX.pl
- added cameratrack.pl and particleFX.pl examples
- wrapped many classes, mainly to make the examples work
- fixed a tiny bug in Ogre::ExampleFrameListener

0.28 2007-09-16 | gtk2-perl and wxPerl
- added a VERY EXPERIMENTAL feature to allow Ogre's render window to be
  an existing Gtk2 or Wx window instead of the defaultly generated one.
  See README.txt for details (you have to have gtk2 libs/headers installed).
  I kind of got it working for Gtk2, see examples/gtk2robot.pl.
  I couldn't get examples/wx.pl to actually work yet, though it's no longer
  segfaulting at least. (I think the Ogre window is underneath the other ones,
  i.e it's the "parent" window.)
- wrapped more methods in RenderWindow, Viewport

0.27 2007-09-12 | constants
- API CHANGE: fixed constants, adding all enums (and genconsts.pl script);
  now you export them normally, not call as static methods.
  Some export tags changed, too; they're all named after the corresponding
  enum's name now. (Note: OIS constants are still "broken".)
  Thanks to Vladimir Olenin for pointing me to `gccxml`, which was used
  in parsing the C++ headers.

0.26 2007-09-09 | documentation
- added some documentation (and gendocs.pl script which generates it)
- added DegRad typemap to handle both Degree or Radian types,
  so now Degree and Radian are interchangeable like in the C++ API
  (and wrapping those methods is simpler :)

0.25 2007-09-07 | animate.pl
- added animate.pl example, which demos animation
  (note: this is still a little incomplete, so the robot moonwalks
   part of the way)

0.24 2007-09-06 | minor improvements
- added typemap for Real and changed all occurrences of float to Real
  (which can be float or double)
- added constructors, overloaded (bool) operators, tests to:
  ColourValue, ConfigFile, Degree, Plane, Quaternion, Radian, Vector3

0.23 2007-09-04 | sky.pl
- moved ExampleFrameListener and ExampleApplication packages from
  examples/buffered.pl out under Ogre/ , so they can be used by other
  applications
- added sky.pl example, which implements OGRE's "Basic Tutorial 3"
- fixed unbuffered input in the Example* classes
- wrapped a lot of SceneManager

0.22 2007-09-02 | buffered.pl
- added buffered.pl, which implements OGRE's "Basic Tutorial 5"

0.21 2007-09-01 |
- added WindowEventListener functionality, though not "tested" yet
  (working on another example)

0.20 2007-08-30 | ninja.pl, listeningninja.pl
- added ninja.pl example, along with necessary wrappers
  to get it to work (you also need to install OIS,
  which I just uploaded to CPAN)
- also added listeningninja.pl example, along with
  FrameListener functionality
- wrapped several other classes, but not fully yet;
  will have another example next release

0.1  2007-08-26 | robot.pl
(Note: I accidentally put version 0.1 instead of 0.01)
- first release, minimal wrapping
- includes robot.pl example
